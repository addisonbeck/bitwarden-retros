<p>
    Goals:
    <ul>
        <li>Review what went well this time around for the release.</li>
        <li>Review what we missed / opportunities for improvement.</li>
        <li>Gauge comfort level from the team surrounding the release process and team dynamic for this release.</li>
    </ul>
    Instructions:
    <ul>
        <li>Complete the "Pulse" survey. This survey is <strong>required</strong> for engineering team members and is <strong>not anonymous</strong> - your email is collected automatically.</li>
        <li>Complete the "Culture" survey. This survey <strong>is anonymous</strong>, and highly encouraged for all engineering team members.</li>
        <li>Responses for both surveys will be shown to you upon submission, and discussed in the retrospective sync meeting.
    </ul>
    No judgement, blaming, baggage or personal chips, we're all here to help each other improve and the product to succeed.
